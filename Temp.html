		<p>My Dearest Vico, As I sit down to write this letter, I can't believe we've been on this fantastic trip together for almost three years. Today, as we mark our two-year and ten-month anniversary, I am overcome with feelings, thankfulness, and a full heart.
		<br>
		The last 34 months have been nothing short of extraordinary. Every day with you has been a page in a wonderful love story, and I treasure each and every one of them. You captivated my heart in ways I never imagined possible from the minute we met. In my life, your love has been a continual source of joy, warmth, and inspiration.
		<br>
		We've had innumerable experiences, faced obstacles, and celebrated wins together throughout the years. We've laughed ourselves sick, wiped each other's tears, and held one other up through the darkest of nights. Our love has only grown stronger, deeper, and more durable as a result of it all.
		<br>
		Your grin still brightens my day, just as it did the first time we met. Your touch still sends thrills down my spine, and your presence gives me tranquility that words cannot express. You are my confidante, my crime partner, and my true love.
		<br>
		I want you to know how much I appreciate your love, compassion, unshakable support, and the way you make me feel like the luckiest person alive. You've turned these last few months into a fantastic experience, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us.
		<br>
		Thank you for being my life's love, my companion on this wonderful adventure, and my best friend. My darling, happy 2 years and 10 months. Here's to us and many more wonderful times ahead.</p>
